VISCO2.5D - Viscoelastic relaxation using a spectral element method in 2.5D
===========================================================================

About
—————

VISCO2.5D is a code for simulating problems in quasi-static deformation.  It computes 3D static and post-seismic motions generated by earthquake dislocation sources on 2D viscoelastic structures.
